# typed-REST

REST API with TypeScript definition. This does not provide runtypes or any validation library.

Of course, this is similar to [RESTyped or rest.ts](https://github.com/hmil/rest.ts/wiki/Rest.ts-vs-RESTyped), but I created this in order to use the latest libraries

- Latest TypeScript
- Latest Axios
